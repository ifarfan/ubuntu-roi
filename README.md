## Oh god, why?!?
I've been using Ubuntu for way longer than I care to admit it: it's been with me in the good times (plenty of those) and in the bad times (luckily only a few). And I've been probably  working on a version of this repo for that long; basically centralizing all the tweaks and tricks I've come to learn over the years for how to make software run optimally on Ubuntu.

I've recently began to work on an **18.04** upgrade for a client and realized this will probably be the last time I get to round up all the collected wisdom from all those years. As the migration to containers and distributed systems continues on Devops, the OS has become another disposable commmodity and doesn't really need that much of a tune-up effort anymore: the work/effort has simply moved to another abstraction layer.

So as a *swam song* of sorts, I'm writing all of this down one last time. *Vive Ubuntu, le Roi!*
